"Iacta" is a Latin word that means "the die" or "the die is cast." It is famously associated with a phrase attributed to Julius Caesar: "Alea iacta est." This phrase is often translated to "The die is cast" or "The die has been cast."

Julius Caesar is believed to have uttered this phrase in 49 BCE as he led his army across the Rubicon River, a boundary in northern Italy. By doing so, he effectively initiated a civil war in Rome. The phrase "The die is cast" is used to express the idea that an irreversible decision has been made, and there is no turning back.

Today, "iacta" or "Alea iacta est" is sometimes used in various contexts to convey the idea that a significant and irreversible decision has been taken or that a critical moment has been reached. It has become a well-known historical reference and is occasionally invoked in literature, politics, and popular culture to symbolize the point of no return
